# Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase provides built-in authentication with JWT tokens
- Always verify JWT tokens on the backend
- Use row-level security (RLS) in Supabase for database access control
- Implement proper session management and token refresh

## API Security
- All API endpoints should validate input
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Validate Stripe webhook signatures

## Database Security
- Use connection pooling with proper credentials
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement proper database migrations
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Payment Security
- Never store credit card information
- Use Stripe's secure payment processing
- Verify webhook signatures before processing
- Implement proper error handling for failed payments

## Infrastructure Security
- Use VPC with private subnets for database and backend services
- Implement security groups with minimal required access
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys where possible
- Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

## Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or similar
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Monitoring & Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up alerting for security events
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Regular security audits and updates
